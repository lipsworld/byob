Build Your Own Browser Installation
===================================

This version of BYOB assumes installation on a single OS X machine for full
functionality, including building repacks.  The web application itself,
however, only requires PHP 5+ and MySQL.

* Ensure the following directories exist, and are writable by the web server:

** application/cache
** application/logs
** downloads
** workspace

* Create a new MySQL database using application/config/schema-mysql/current.sql

* From recaptcha.net, get a public & private key for the domain name where the
    site to be installed and hosted.

* In the application/config directory, copy config-local.php-dist to 
    config-local.php and edit the settings as necessary:

** The database.local structure should be given the MySQL credentials to 
    access the database created in the previous step.
** Change the recaptcha.* settings to reflect the domain, public key, and
    private key data acquired from recaptcha.net
** Change the email.* settings to reflect local email environment.
*** Set email.driver to 'native' if PHP itself is setup to send email
*** Set email.driver to 'smtp' and update email.options if an external SMTP
    server is to be used.
** Ensure core.display_errors is FALSE to prevent verbose error messages
** Set core.log_threshold to 0 to prevent logging to application/logs
** Change core.site_domain to the domain name of the web host, deleting the
    code to guess the domain name for dev servers.

* To enable the work queue for repack build management:

** Ensure the CLI version of PHP5 is installed
** Copy bin/exhaust-queue.sh-dist to bin/exhaust-queue.sh and edit the absolute
    path to the php CLI executable.
** Copy bin/org.mozilla.byob.cron.plist-dist to bin/org.mozilla.byob.cron.plist-dist
    and edit the absolute path to the bin/exhaust-queue.sh script
** Finally, to enable the periodic launchd task, run:
*** sudo launchctl load bin/org.mozilla.byob.cron.plist
